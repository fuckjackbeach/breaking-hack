Project: Breaking Hack
  A 3 level game inspired by the hit tv show, Breaking Bad, with a spin to be related to programming. The purpose of my project is to create a fun interactive story game. BY the end of the semester i'd like my project to have Mulitple characetrs, dialogue and working physics as well as a story. I have done this project using Python, Pygame, OOP, VSCode and Github.
